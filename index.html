                    My name is Kane Lo Hog Tian. This website has been developed to show some of my skills and experience.<br> 
                    I am now working as full time developer at Greenlight Innovation Corp, Burnaby, BC.
                    I have 8 months Co-op experience in Greenlight Innovation as Information System Developer from September 2020 to May 2021 and in Kongsberg Mesotech as Software Engineer from January 2019 to August 2019.<br><br>
                    I have continued part time job as Software Developer at Greenlight until my graduation.
                    I also worked as a User Interface Research and Web Tester as part time during my study at Simon Fraser University.<br><br>
                    I finished my undergraduate study with a CGPA of 3.88 and I have received the President's Honour Roll and Dean's Honour Roll.<br><br>
                    I am passionate in soccer, software and web development and volunteering.

                        <h5>
                           I am currently working on Portal which is an internal web app at Greenlight Innovation Corp located at Burnaby. I am working with a small group of developers
                           to implement features to improve the Supply Chain process. As portal grows, many different departments have started to be interested in implementing their own features on Portal.<br><br>
                           One of those departments are Payroll and Accounting which requested to migrate from Excel based timesheet to Web app timesheet. My team and I underwent regular scrum meeting and iterations to
                           develop the timesheet app on Portal. As from March 2021, employees have started to use our timesheet app to record their working hours and payroll uses the web app to pay employees.
                           Portal is developed in Django, Jquery, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS, using Postgresql database<br><br>
                           While working as part time, I also learned C# and Angular as my team has taken the part catalog app which helps engineers to record and view parts information. I am now the main developer of the app.

                        <h5>
                            I developed an android tablet application and a desktop application using Qt framework and C++.
                            The android application is developed to replace the physical remote control which is used to control the sonar systems developed by the company. 
                            The sonar systems are connected to the desktop computer and will communicate to the desktop application.
                            The android application and desktop application can act as a server and a client which can connect to each other by bluetooth or ethernet option, giving the user different connection options.
                            The remote control application not only has a keypad but can also display sensor values received from the sonar systems as well as display a graph showing the patterns in the temperature and depth sensor values against time.

                            Using SpringBoot web framework, Java, IntelliJ, HTML and CSS, I developed an online Hangman game
                            where the player will win a game by guessing a word randomly picked by the system and can make 7 incorrect guesses before losing the game.<br>
                            You can have a look at my repository <a href="https://github.com/KaneLo97/Online-Hangman/"> Online Hangman Game</a> 
                            I have also developed a hangman game in this website using mainly Jquery.
